## 01_Te.ipynb – Exploratory Data Analysis

This notebook explores the **Telco Customer Churn** dataset containing 7043 customers and 21 variables. The goal is to understand factors influencing customer churn. Key steps include:
- Inspecting missing data and class distribution (≈27 % churn rate)
- Visualising numeric features such as tenure and MonthlyCharges
- Comparing churn vs non-churn customers with boxplots and bar charts
- Generating insights that guide feature engineering for later modelling
